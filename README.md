## Tailwind CSS Framework (v3.3.3)

### Project: 

##
Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.
