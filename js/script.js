"use strict";
/* You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables. 

In normal JavaScript, a developer will not receive any error feedback assigning values to non-writable properties.

In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.
